Dear David Powell,

I regret to inform you that your submission entitled

"Modelling and Shuffling: The significance of alignments and matches for medium
or low information sequences"

has not been accepted to ISMB 2003. The competition was
very tough this year, with only 35 out of 242 long manuscripts
being accepted, and 13 out of 100 short manuscripts being
accepted. We do thank you for your submission to the
conference.
  
A copy of the referees comments is included below.

Best regards,

  The ISMB03 PC Committee.

First reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

Adds the idea of using the left-context of each sequence
position in score computation during sequence alignment by
DP.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

This is a nice paper. The idea of using the left-context of
the sequence positions being aligned when calculating the match
probability is very nice. Intuitively, this should reduce the
tendency of low-information artifacts in sequences getting large
alignment scores (or probabilities). This should lead to improved
sequence database search accuracy, by avoiding such false positives.

The paper, unfortunately, fails to establish this intution as fact.
The experimental results section compares using their algorithm
in total probability mode with Smith-Waterman and PRSS, both of which
only consider the score of the optimal alignment. As the authors
of this paper state, summing over all alignments is a better test
of sequence relatedness than simply using the optimal alignment.
It is not clear, therefore, whether the improved search accuracy
is coming from the new alignment algorithm, or from using total
probability instead of Viterbi. To know which is true, the authors
should compare their total probability scores with total
probability using a standard left-to-right HMM (using HMMER, for example).
Alternatively, they could compare the probability of the optimal
(Viterbi) path using their algorithm with SW and PRSS.

The match-mismatch update formulas: are they arbitrary? The
authors should explain what probability their score function is
actually calculating.

The paper defines the conditional probabilities of sequence 
characters, but where does it define Pr(match), Pr(mismatch),
Pr(Delete) etc? Explain how and why these are set.

On p6, what does the notation "x<>y" mean? (Use the "not equals"
notation, please.) 

Typos:
p2 Constant 'a' should be Constant 'b'

Important:
If accepted, you must ensure that the paper is 10 pages maximum,
not 12!

Second reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

This paper takes sequence alignment by dynamic programming and applies
population models. This allows better modelling of different types of sequence
characteristics. This can be used in order to detect true and false positive
matches in data base searches or to produce better alignments between 2
sequences. It naturally allows easy significance testing.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

This paper has good points and bad points.
The good points seem very clear. The approach certainly could be of great
benefit in helping to do better similarity searches of databases. The
applications are enormous and this paper describes what genuinely seem to be
useful developments. What I found hard was that the manuscript was perhaps
hastily put together (if not, I apologise). I found it hard work to understand.
The figures were cryptic and badly placed (e.g. no legends or legends with no
details). The test cases were few and did not give much idea as to exactly how
generally useful this is. The ms. was too long and had too many references
(guidelines 10 pages total??). It may seem unfair to criticise the paper
because of the manuscript but I had to read this very quickly and I found it
hard to understand.

trivial points:
1) figure 1 is nice as a summary but it has no explanation of symbols. Some are
obvious but many are not. It is also in the text 3 pages after it is first
mentioned. 
2) on page 7 it was not clear if DNA or protein was being considered (it later
becoems clear that it is DNA).
3) the examples on page 9 are interesting but there is little detail. These
look quite convincing. It would help if there were more examples or more
details. The exact reasons why these pieces were chosen are not explained
(although, I can guess some of the reasons).

Third reviewer's review:

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

The authors present a new local pairwise alignment algorithm that takes into
account the information content of the sequences to be aligned. Low-complexity
regions are automatically down-weighted. This way an explicit masking
of repeat regions becomes unnecessary.
In the end of the paper, results on artificially generated and real
sequences are presented.

          >>> Evaluation <<<

The contents of the paper are very interesting. The general approach
seems to make very much sense, and an implementation of the algorithm
could be very useful.

The style of the paper, however, is very confusing: It is difficult to
see a logical order in the write-up. Rather, some sections seem to be
collections of several independent paragraphs. The authors should try to
concentrate on the important messages of the paper, and omit repetitions
and uninformative side remarks.

More specific suggestions:
* The recurrences in Figure 1 should be explained somewhere.
* Several important notions are used without proper definition,
e.g. "rank-order", "probability of an alignment", "population model".
* Some propositions are made several times in the paper, e.g. the criticism
of Z-scores as proposed by Needleman and Wunsch or the (important)
point that low complexity regions give some information but not as much
as high-complexity regions.
* The paper contains empty phrases like "... can, and should, ..."
* The language should be simplified where possible, e.g. the sentence
"The ratio in these probabilities ..." on p.4.
* The notation <> (meaning unequality?) is not standard.
* In Section 7.1, what is meant by "-16 and -4 for the first and subsequent
characters in a sequence"? (Gap penalties?)
* In Section 7.1, 3rd paragraph, is ".." denoting concatenation?
* If the exact method used for mutations is "intereting in itself, but
distracting at this point", it could maybe be put in an appendix or be cited
from a technical report if such exists.
* In Figure 6 (headline), what is the meaning of "MM order = -1"?
* I am not sure if the "real" data set (157 bases, partly intron, partly
exon) is a realistic database query sequence. In the last experiment,
what can be said about the 240 database sequences that rank higher than
the fragment from PFB0045c? A more realistic experiment would be to
"hide" the whole pseudo-gene in the database and then test if the
related fragment is found by the (local!) M-alignment algorithm.
