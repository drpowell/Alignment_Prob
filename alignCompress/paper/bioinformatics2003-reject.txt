Title: Modelling-Alignment for Sequences of Mixed or of Medium
to Low Information-Content  

Dear Dr. Powell

The reviews of your manuscript are now in hand.  Both reviewers
had substantial concerns about the manuscript and the Associate
Editor concurs with their opinion.  As the journal receives more
publishable manuscripts than its space will accommodate,
acceptance must be limited to manuscripts receiving the most
favourable recommendations from reviewers.  Unfortunately, I
must decline your request to have the manuscript published in
Bioinformatics.  

On behalf of the Executive Editor, I want to thank you for
considering Bioinformatics to present your work.  I look forward
to the possibility of receiving other manuscripts from you in
the future.

Yours sincerely

Ms. Annette Aylward
Editorial Office, Bioinformatics


Here are the comments of the reviewers:
----------------------------------------
Reviewer 1 Comments:
     This paper describes the use of a pair HMM for sequence
alignment, where the probability of indel sequences is given by
an order-k Markov model.

The authors include no reference to the extensive use of pair
HMMs in bioinformatics over the past 10 years (see, for example,
the book by Durbin, Eddy, Krogh and Mitchison). Instead they
introduce new terminology that I found confusing and
unnecessary. For example, their "M-alignment" algorithm could
have been greatly simplified by being described as a pair HMM. I
also found the term "population model" an awkward complication
of the concept of a probabilistic model for sequence data.

The idea of using an order-k Markov model to build a
low-complexity filter into pairwise alignment is a reasonable
one (if rather basic). However, the tests on "real data" (some
pseudogenes and stretches of Plasmodium DNA) that are presented
here do not give such astoundingly good results that they
compensate for the paucity of references in the work.


Reviewer 2 Comments:
     The authors presented a new method to incorporate
population models into the alignment process. The new method was
tested on both the artificial data and real DNA sequences. As
reported by the authors there are less errors using M-alignment
on complicated population models, compared with sequence
shuffling, a standard significance test. The developed algorithm
and its analysis have some scientific
values to the bioinformatics community.

However, the proposed method does not represent an advance in
bioinformatics. Or practically, the work is not enough as a full
paper in the journal. Modelling the alignment of protein
sequences could be more interesting, but it is not implemented
and there is no data analysis. If protein alignment can be done
in the some way as DNA sequence, even on simple population
models, I am happy to reconsider my recommendation.


Further comments:

(1) On real data comparison between prss and M-alignment, there
is a huge difference in the number of sequences with a
significant score. Out of 60765, prss found more than 10000
sequences, while this number is only 1300 for M-alignment! This
does concern me. Sensitivity and specificity are not directly
related. BLAST and FASTA have been used for so many years. There
might be problems, but not in this scale, just
assuming M-alignment order is correct. It would be good if the
authors can provide more examples. There must be cases in which
sequences are related and picked up by BLAST but missed in the
M-alignment list.

(2) It seems to me that all the authors are from computer
science background. The terms used in the paper are not always
familiar by bioinformatician. I would suggest that the authors
ask a non-computer biologist to read the paper and get some
feedbacks.
